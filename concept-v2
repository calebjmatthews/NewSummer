Raise plants from wild origins to well-known crops and life entirely new.

Basic gameplay:
	- Cross-breed two plants (averaged time of the plants x2.5)
	- Choose to keep one of the three resulting plants
	- Grow plants in purchased fields (15min to 8hr depending on species / genes)
	- Used harvested plants for money or research
	- Researched plants are destroyed, but have a chance on revealing an undiscovered gene
	- Cross-breed again, using discovered genes to guide decision making
	- Money can be used to buy new wild seeds for breeding stock, new fields, access to new plant families, storage space, breeding choice slots, and other minor things (like fertilizer)
	- Quests challenge the player to grow in unforgiving conditions in new temporary fields, to discover new cultivars, to breed plants with specific genotypes, or to harvest cultivars with exceptionally high quality

Begin with:
	- Two variable-weather (varies by week?), poor soil plots
	- Three bags of wild grass (Poaceae) seeds
	- One cross-breeding garden
	- Storage space for five

UI:
	- Navigation bar on top with links to Experimental Garden, available fields, tasks, guidebook

Example round:
	1. In Eastern Rough Field, planted Bitter Grass
	2. In Western Rough Field, planted Hearty Grass
	3. In the Exeperimental Garden, cross-bred Hearty Grass and Highland Grass
	4. After 18 minutes, Hearty Grass was harvested, with all bushels going to Easy Research.  83% progress was made on a new Unknown Gene
	5. In Western Rough Field, planted Highland Grass
	6. After 22 minutes, Bitter Grass was harvested, with all bushels being sold for a total of $122
	7. In Western Rough Field, planted Highland Grass
	8. Cross-breeding is finished after 40 minutes: Sour Emmer is chosen over Sweet Grass and Sierra Grass
	9. Discovering Emmer has completed a quest, the reward is two new bags of Wild Grass Seed. Discovering Emmer also added a new entry to the guidebook
	10.The bags are opened, inside is Plentiful Grass and Wetland Grass
	11.After 24 minutes, Highland Grass is harvested, with one bushel continuing the previous Easy Research.  A new gene is discovered: Damp Resistance.  Now when Hearty Grass, Bitter Grass, Highland Grass, Plentiful Grass, and Wetland Grass are viewed on the detail screen an icon will show the genotype.  The gene itself can also be seen in more detail in the guidebook.

Example plant rendering:


Cultivars:
* Poaceae (Grasses)
	- Corn: C4, high yield, high nutrient and light demand, seeds in ears
	- Wheat: High yield, seeds in seed heads, relatively little protection
	- Oats: Seeds in florets, tolerates high moisture
	- Rye: Grows well in poor soil conditions, seeds in seed heads
	- Emmer: Seed in seed heads, primitive grain
	- Rice: Seed in seed heads, can tolerate high moisture / salt
	- Millet: Seed in fox tails, fast-growing, tolerates high heat and dryness
	- Sorghum: Drought and heat tolerant
	- Sugar Cane: Cane investment, high sugar content
	- Bamboo: Cane investment, high plant toughness
* Brassicaceae (Crucifers)
* Solanaceae (Nightshade)
* Rosaceae (Rose)
* Lamiaceae (Mint)
* Rutaceae (Citrus)
* Cucurbitaceae (Gourd)
* Apiaceae (Celery)

Traits:
	- Seed morphology: Exact shape that seed toughness takes, plants with low to no seed toughness will ignore this trait; results are: seed heads, florets, fox tails, ears
	- Carbon fixation 4: Alternate photosynthesis strategy, rewards high light and high fertility conditions
	- Chemical defense: Can change flavor of fruit or crop, between bitter, spicy, or sour; if too intense the crop will be inedible
	- Stem investment: Leads to the crop being cane-like, seeds no longer are focus of harvesting
	- Plant toughness: Requires small investment, protects against pests, decreases yield
	- Plant size: Requires moderate investment, can support higher yields
	- Seed bunches: (e.g. size of oat floret bunch)
	- Seed quantity: (e.g. number of oat florets)
	- Starch: Amount of starch stored in seeds, increases harvest quality
	- Sweetness: Amount of sugar stored in seeds, increases harvest quality
	- Protein: Amount of protein stored in seeds, increases harvest quality
	- Vitamins: Vitamin content in seeds, increases harvest quality, split this?
	- Nitrogen usage: Extent to which the plant is benefitted by high soil nitrogen
	- Poor fertility tolerance: Extent to which the plant can tolerate low soil nitrogen
	- Heat tolerance: Retain harvest despite high heat, requires investment
	- Cold tolerance: Retain harvest despite high cold, requires investment
	- Wetness tolerance: Retain harvest despite high moisture, requires investment
	- Dryness tolerance: Retain harvest despite high dryness, requires investment
	- Defense structures: Things like spines or thorns, reduce pest damage
	- Growth speed: How long it takes to grow and cross-breed the plant
	- Flower Color: For fun
	- Fruit/Seed Color: For fun

	- A newly bred or discovered cultivar has three descriptors, randomly selected from the cultivar's notable traits, such as "Bitter tasting grain" or "Fast growing"
	- A newly bred or discovered cultivar also has an adjective to accompany their name, randomly selected from the cultivar's notable traits (see below)

Adjectives:
	- Bitter, Sweet, Sour, Spicy, Aromatic, Wetland, Highland, Summer, Winter, Hearty, Plentiful, Glorious, Thorny, Tough, Delicious, Healthy

Purchaseable:
	- New wild seeds, new seeds of discovered cultivars, more crossbreeding choice slots (4, 5, 6), more seed storage space
	- A higher total money earned (including money spent) opens up new "trading partners" which means new wild family options (possibly begin with a seed set of five?)

Defects:
	- One or two hundred different defect genes, maybe four classes that have different 	functional effects
	- This way, even if every wild individual comes with 3-5 heterozygous defects, none of them are likely to be expressed until a moderate amount of inbreeding occurs
	- Possible effects are...
	- Withered: Low growth
	- Barren: No fruit production
	- Sterile: No seed production
	- Weak: Vulnerable to pests or temperature

Classes:
Plant
~~~~~
- Gene: Boolean / Boolean genetic value, associated methods, name, dominance/codominance, names for possible gene results

Game
~~~~
- Game: Contains the current state of the game, the FieldOfView, the current player, and global variables as attributes
- State: Varying functional states of the game, and properties they contain (such as whether the user can take action, or whether notifications can be displayed), also acts as a listener for events
- PixieEvent: Events that are tied to Pixie instancies, to be called when the area the instance occupies is clicked, for example
- FieldOfView: Contains all visual elements and the screen size when the app is opened

Other ideas
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Send out expeditions for new plant types, using harvested crops as supplies
- New crop discovery (based on degree of variation from previously discovered) contributes to global population
- Quests (Jobs? Tasks?) that reward player for breeding a specific kind of plant, no time limit
- Economy that rewards novelty as well as quality/quantity
- Specific family that can only be bred during contest events, with seeds that disappear when the event is over (roses? orchids?)

Main game loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Four times each second the game checks progress of plants toward maturity
- Clicking field brings up seed options (family->cultivar->seed)
- Clicking seed option plants seed
- Clicking experimental garden brings up seed options

Differentiating cultivars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Poaceae:
- Seed morpholohy:
	- Emmer: Spiked, hulled, awned, small ears
	- Corn: Kernels in husk covered ears (600 kernals per ear)
	- Wheat: Spiked, hulled, small ears
	- Oats: Seeds in florets, tolerates high moisture
	- Rye: Spiked, hulled, awned, small ears
	- Rice: Seed in mini-florets in seeds heads
	- Millet: Seed in fox tails
	- Sorghum: Seeds in denser seed heads
	- Sugar Cane: Cane investment
	- Bamboo: Cane investment

- Definitional morphology features: covering (husk, floret, or hull), branching, seed size, seeds throughout, final plant size stat
					Crn	Wht	Oat	Ric	Mlt	Srg	Rye	Bmb	Sug
Husk			1		0		0		0		0		0		0		0		0
Floret		0		0		1		1		0		0		0		1		0
Hull			0		1		0		0		1		1		1		0		1
Branching	0		0		0		1		0		1		0		0		1
Seed siz	4		1		0		1		2		1		0		0		0
Stem foc	0		0		0		0		0		0		0		1		1
Final sz	4		1		0		3		2		3		1		1		2

- Other morphology features: height, thickness, seeds throughout, density
- Seed capacity calculated from height and thickness; if a plant is not big enough, it can't support a high quantity of seeds
- Plant size is calculated from branching, seed size, stem focus, and stem thickness. Visual/functional density of plants comes from the density trait relative to this size stat

Pixi.js drawing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Class that stores the pixi app and container objects and performs baseline operations on them
- In stage, we have a sprite for the background, and a sprite container that holds each field card
- Function to scroll from card to card
- Function to plant a seed, and therefore draw the seed texture
- Function to age up a seed into the next texture in its array
- Function to remove a sprite once the plant has been harvested

Descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Growth time stat in hours/minutes/seconds
- Value in ideal conditions super-stat
- Temperature tolerance/moisture tolerance traits when moderate or high
- Flavor super-stat if anything other than none
- Too much seed quantity for stem height/thickness super-stat
- Pest resistance stat if moderate or high
- Disease resistance stat if moderate or high
- Nitrogen requirement stat if low or high

Visual appearance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Seed covering trait (unique pixel art for each phenotype)
- Branching trait
- Stem focus trait (bamboo-like stem)
- Seed size stat (unique pixel art for 4? different size buckets)
- Temperature tolerance/moisture tolerance traits to change red/blue balance and saturation of stem and foliage
- Stem height trait
- Seeds throughout trait

Brainstorming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A family:
Scientific name, common name, list of possible traits, list of identified cultivars, method for turning stats into quantity/quality/visual appearance/name/description
A cultivar:
Name, list of definitional stats, optional bonus
A trait:
Name, number of loci, method for turning loci into stats
A seed:
Name, description, cultivar, genome, method of breeding with another seed
A field:
Cold vs hot, wet vs dry, pest vs none, disease vs none, nitrogen level, increased pollination

Randomly generated seeds come from family-specific lists of trait numerators with a count of traits to be truly randomly generated.

Equation for sinusoidal movement is:
Velocity = ((((endingPosition - startingPosition) / numberOfTimeSteps) / 0.6353102368) * sin(pi*percentCompletion)

Sample flavor descriptions could be: Slightly sweet, An intense and unpleasant blend of many flavors, A delicious blend of intensely spicy and slightly bitter flavors, A curious blend of moderately spicy and slightly sour flavors, An unpleasant blend of moderately sweet and slightly complex flavors
Parts of this are...
An intensity descriptor: intensely, moderately, slightly
A positivity descriptor: delicious, curious, unpleasant
Flavor words: blend of many flavors, blend of flavor1/flavor2, flavor1

Bug fixing / balance needs:
X Fix plant breeding
X Fix pixi addition of new field
X Fix pixi rendering on load of in progress seeds
- Inspect temp/mois thresholds
X Fix seed gen based on cultivar
X Mild rebalancing of traits
X Flesh out mature seed selling
- More rebalancing of traits

Wanderers:
~~~~~~~~~~
properties: name, frequency, visitRemaining, affection, offers, dialogues, gifts

Seed trader: Overall clad lady, friendly; offers seeds with default 1 variation of currently discovered cultivars, occasionally offers 3 variation, then offers
	Dialogue:
	- Some traits that seem harmful have hidden benefits. For example, plants that require fertile soil are more difficult to raise, but grow fast and taste better.
	- Today my stock comes from far, far away. No guarantees, but there may be traits here you've never seen before.
	- Variety is crucial. If you keep breeding the same seeds together, your crops will stop improving.
	- I am a maid of constant sorrow. I've seen trouble all my days.
	- I look forward to visiting your little homestead. The air is sweet here.
Explorer: Indiana Jones type; offers initial quests, then telegram pole, then expeditions
Craftsman: Bulky, goggles; offers experimental garden improvements, storage improvements, aesthetic farmhouse improvements
Tailor: Gentleman in suit; Offers aesthetic clothing options made from various crops

Frequency/duration mechanics:
	- Default duration of a traveler visit is 5 minutes
	- Frequency describes the likelihood of a traveler being in a visiting state in any given moment
	- Therefore with a duration of 300 seconds and a frequency of .2, a visit event would occur once in 1500 seconds (25 minutes), and the probability of
	- A check is made every second to see if a traveler arrives
	- The probability of a traveler arriving is 1/(300/.2) = .00067 or 0.067%
	- Mandatory cooldown period equal to duration (300 seconds)

Seed trader, steps to create current offerings:
	1. Number of options = 3 + Math.floor(ln(# unlocked cultivars))
	2. For each option, select an unlocked cultivar and make a seed with variation of 1 (90%) of time or 3 (10%) of time
	3. If resulting seed's name already exists in the seed options, retry
	4. Seeds are priced according to (((the theoretical price of the plant - the base price of the plant) / the base price of the plant) + 1) ^ 2

Seed add/discard dialogue
	1. Click "buy" on displayed seed
	2. If not enough money, show explanatory note and cancel
	3. Otherwise, deduct the money, show seed to be added on top, possibly with label "NEW"
	4. Show all cultivars's seeds below, can be clicked to highlight
	5. "Trash" and "Cancel" buttons below this, "Trash" becomes enabled when something has been highlighted
	6. If cancelled, the function returns false and deducted money is returned
	7. If something is trashed, it is removed from the storehouse, the new seed is added to the storehouse, and the function returns true

Record Book:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Records each seed bred, bought, or otherwise obtained, with all its information including genome, name, method obtained, and parents (if any)
- Each seed is stored in a three layer dictionary, where family is the outermost, cultivar is the middle, and individual id is the innermost
- When being displayed, the record book shows each discovered cultivar with individuals listed beneath in player selected order (default is value high, other options are value low, growth time high, growth time low, newest, oldest)
- Also records each trait discovered (many are shared between families). Many traits are only marked as discovered when expression is high (Stem focus, Sourness, etc), but others are distinctly discoverable at either end (Tolerance: heat vs. Tolerance: cold)

Seed Breeding UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Experimental garden:
	- If not breeding, show "Experimental Garden: Breed two seeds together"
	- If breeding, show "Experimental plants are growing: 8m 4s"

Breeding selection:
	- Store "seedBreeding", parentA, and parentB in card state
	- Flow:
		- For seed A, show cultivar selection, then seed selection
		- For seed B, show cultivar selection, then seed selection
		- Show confirmation screen with seed descriptions for both
		- Set storehouse seed breeding props
