Game Flow
~~~~~~~~~
- Poaceae have 8 forms/stages:
	~ Seed (Gt), before selecting a field and planting
	~ Used Seed (Gt), the inactive genotype remnant after planting seed
	~ Pollen (Gt), 3 produced by every immature plant
	~ Used Pollen (Gt), the inactive genotype remnant after breeding with pollen
	~ Unfertilized (Pt), before selecting other plant/self to pollinate
	~ Fertilized (Pt), produces seed for planting or selling, default is to keep 2
	~ Expired (Pt), the inactive phenotype remnant after harvesting
	~ Cutting (Gt), left behind after harvesting perennial, can be replanted
